## **Overview**
Delays in flight schedules can disrupt travel plans and lead to financial losses. This project utilizes machine learning to predict delays based on various factors. The web-based interface enables users to:
1. Upload and preview datasets.
2. Make single or batch predictions.
3. Visualize predictions through an intuitive UI.

## **Features**
- **File Upload**: Upload datasets for batch processing.
- **Preview Data**: View dataset contents directly in the web interface.
- **Prediction**: Use a pre-trained model to predict flight delays.
- **Visualization**: Display predictions in graphical formats.
- **Interactive UI**: Navigate between pages like Home, Abstract, Future Scope, Login, and Upload.
