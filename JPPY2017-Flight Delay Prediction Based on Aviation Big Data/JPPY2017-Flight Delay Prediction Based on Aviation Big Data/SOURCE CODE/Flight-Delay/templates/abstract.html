  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>Accurate flight delay prediction is fundamental to
establish the more efficient airline business. Recent studies have
been focused on applying machine learning methods to predict
the flight delay. Most of the previous prediction methods are conducted in a single route or airport. This paper explores a broader
scope of factors which may potentially influence the flight delay,
and compares several machine learning-based models in designed
generalized flight delay prediction tasks. To build a dataset
for the proposed scheme, automatic dependent surveillancebroadcast (ADS-B) messages are received, pre-processed, and
integrated with other information such as weather condition,
flight schedule, and airport information. The designed prediction
tasks contain different classification tasks and a regression task.
Experimental results show that long short-term memory (LSTM)
is capable of handling the obtained aviation sequence data, but
overfitting problem occurs in our limited dataset. Compared with
the previous schemes, the proposed random forest-based model
can obtain higher prediction accuracy (90.2% for the binary
classification) and can overcome the overfitting problem. </P>
