  <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
  <p>In this paper, random forest-based and LSTM-based architectures have been implemented to predict individual flight
delay. The experimental results show that the random forestbased method can obtain good performance for the binary
classification task and there are still room for improving
the multi-categories classification tasks. The LSTM-based
architecture can obtain relatively higher training accuracy,
which suggests that the LSTM cell is an effective structure
to handle time sequences. However, the overfitting problem
occurred in the LSTM-based architecture still needs to be
solved. In summary, the random forest-based architecture
presented better adaptation at a cost of the training accuracy
when handling the limited dataset. In order to overcome the
overfitting problem and to improve the testing accuracy for
multi-categories classification tasks, our future work will focus
on collecting or generating more training data, integrating
more information like airport traffic flow, airport visibility into
our dataset, and designing more delicate networks.</P>
